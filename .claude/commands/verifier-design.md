Delegate to the **`verifier` subagent** (via the Task tool) in **Design Mode**.

**Inputs:** $ARGUMENTS

The subagent extracts numbered acceptance criteria, invokes the test-design skills (`activity-e2e-test-design`, `activity-contract-test-design`, `activity-edge-case-refinement`, `activity-random-test-tactics`), and writes `/workstream/test-plan-*.md` + `/workstream/traceability-matrix-*.md`, then publishes a summary/link into the GitHub issue. Hand off to `/developer`, then run `/verifier-audit` after implementation.
